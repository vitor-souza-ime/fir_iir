# 🎧 FIR and IIR Filter Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates the design, application, and analysis of digital FIR and IIR filters using `scipy.signal`, with graphical visualizations via `matplotlib`.

## 📌 Overview

The script performs signal filtering over four types of signals:

- 🔵 **Sine wave** (50 Hz)
- ⚪ **White Gaussian noise**
- ⚡ **Dirac impulse**
- 🌀 **Mixed signal** (sine + noise)

Two types of digital filters are implemented:

- 🟩 **FIR** (Finite Impulse Response) — designed with a Hamming window
- 🟥 **IIR** (Butterworth filter of 4th order)

Each filter is applied to the signals, and various plots are generated for frequency and time domain analysis.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
````

## 🚀 How to Run

Simply execute the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧪 Features

### ✅ Filter Design

* FIR filter: Hamming window, 51 taps, 100 Hz cutoff
* IIR filter: 4th-order Butterworth, 100 Hz cutoff

### ✅ Signal Types

* Pure sinusoidal
* Random white noise
* Unit impulse
* Composite signal

### ✅ Visual Analysis

For each filter:

* 📈 Frequency response (magnitude in dB)
* 🔁 Impulse response
* 🧱 Step response

For each signal:

* 📊 Comparison of original vs. filtered output

## 🖼️ Sample Output

Plots generated by the script include:

* Frequency response of FIR and IIR filters
* Impulse and step responses
* Signal comparison (original vs filtered)

> You can enable image saving in the code by adding `plt.savefig("plot_name.png")` before `plt.show()` if you wish to keep copies of the outputs.
